                        <p>With this build we’ll be helping out all those players interested in making a Stamina Templar from scratch.  We’ll be offering mainly PvE build suggestions, but a few abilities will be vital to PvP as well with.  Feel free to experiment and augment some of the more PvE abilities into other ones if you’re planning on being a PvP main instead.</p>

                        <h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 40px"><strong >Should You Play This Build?</strong></h1>
                        <p>If you’re a fan of solo play and smaller group activities, then the Magicka Warden offers a fresh and new play style for players interested in a hearty mixture of damage and support.  While the Magicka Warden doesn’t pull solid “competitive” DPS numbers, they are fun to play and can still tackle almost any content with enough dedication and practice.  If you’re not looking to post impressive scores on leaderboards and you just want something fun and different to play; then the Mag Warden will be a great choice for you.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SDual Wield Bar | Main Damage Bar</strong></p>
                        <ol style="display: block;">
                            <li style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;While the Restoration staff doesn’t boast raw damage for leveling, it does give us plenty of healing and resource management once we start unlocking passives.
                                <ol>
                                    <li style="text-align: left;">Grand Healing (AoE Heal over time | morph to preference) – A staple in terms of universal healing, any healer in the game will often find this skill to be their go to ability for healing more than one person at a time.  Easy to use with a 6 ally target cap, we’ll have morph options to either add more healing (Illustrious Healing) or help our Magicka sustain (Healing Springs).</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: left;">Regeneration (HoT | morph to Rapid Regeneration) – This ability works wonderfully in smaller groups, as it only hits up to 2 allies per cast.  It can be casted as many times as you want, but not everyone will gain effect.  For example, if you’re in a 4 man group you’ll want to cast it twice in quick succession, or if you’re in a 12 man group you’ll need to cast it 6 times.  It quickly becomes tedious in larger groups, so try and only use this for solo or small group situations.

                                    </li>
                                    <li  style="text-align: left;>
                                        Steadfast Ward (Shield | morph to Healing Ward) – A wonderful damage shield that explodes into a burst heal after 6 seconds, depending on the size of the shield remaining.  The shield grows in size based on how much missing Health you have, allowing it to be insanely powerful in solo PvE and especially PvP application.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Repentance (morph of Restoring Aura | Restoring Light skill line) – A wonderful skill that will help our Stamina management immensely.&nbsp; Cast this whenever you see a body or two (can only be used once per corpse) and get 10% of your Stamina (and some Health) per corpse.&nbsp; If you’re fighting a boss that doesn’t have adds, you can use this as a flex spot.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Biting Jabs (morph of Puncturing Sweeps | Aedric Spear skill line) – Our primary form of damage, or ‘spammable’.&nbsp; This offers us great single target AND cleave damage, and is a big reason we don’t really need to rely on Steel Tornado for most fights.&nbsp; It will also proc our Burning Light passive and activate our Piercing Spear passive for extra Critical Hit Damage/healing!&nbsp; When in doubt, jabs out!</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Power of the Light (morph of Backlash | Dawn’s Wrath skill line) – The skill that makes the Stamina Templar a thing, this skill grants our raid 2-4% extra DPS to a target, as long as they have mitigation to shred.&nbsp; It also copies a portion of all damage that the target takes, and explodes (there’s a cap, so no one shotting bosses, sorry!) for big boi damage.&nbsp; Try to keep this up 100%!</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Deadly Cloak (morph of Blade Cloak | Dual Wield skill line) – Now boasting a staggering 25% AoE damage reduction, this skill helps Stamina builds stay in the fight in harsh combat. &nbsp;Many skills in dungeons and trials have also been updated to be considered AoE damage, giving us much needed tankiness.
                                <ol>
                                    <li style="text-align: left;">Flex Option; Resolving Vigor (morph of Vigor | Alliance War Assault skill line) – A massive AoE heal over time accessible to anyone who’s ventured into Cyrodiil for a while. &nbsp;The healing potential this skill enables is massive, as well as giving some added group utility.&nbsp; We have room on our backbar for this, but some players might prefer it on their front bar instead.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul >
                            <li>Ultimate Option 1 (Classic) Flawless or Smiting Dawnbreaker (morph of Dawnbreaker | Fighter’s Guild skill line) – A potent AoE Ultimate that can be casted in a cone in front of you, dealing high burst and a decent DoT that lasts 5 seconds. &nbsp;Flawless offers more passive damage, while Smiting offers more Ultimate damage and a stun to targets hit. &nbsp;This will also do bonus damage to Undead, Daedra, and Werewolves.</li>
                        </ul>




                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bow Bar | Support Damage & Buffs</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rearming&nbsp;Trap (morph of Trap Beast | Fighter’s Guild skill line) – A universal powerhouse to any Stamina (and even some Magicka) builds. &nbsp;Enabling great damage via Minor Force for 12 seconds, as well as a hefty single target DoT to the enemy it procs on. &nbsp;It can also root minor enemies in place for a bit, and will deal massive bonus damage to Undead, Deadra, and Werewolves.&nbsp; You can run this on your front bar in a flex spot if you want more passive Weapon Damage, but I like how it lines up on our back bar personally.</li>
                            <li>Poison Injection (morph of Poison Arrow | Bow skill line) – A truly superb DoT ability that also acts as an execute on targets at or below 50% Health. &nbsp;It can be casted from a range as well, helping keep up pressure when you need to retreat from the battle for a moment. &nbsp;The damage the DoT deals will also be amplified by the Hawk Eye passive, even after swapping off the bow bar. &nbsp;Always make sure to actively light attack on this bar!</li>
                            <li>Endless Hail (morph of Volley | Bow skill line) – Another classic DoT ability, but this one functions as an AoE as well. &nbsp;Paired with a Maelstrom Bow, this skill instantly becomes our most important form of damage, even after swapping to our Dual Wield bar. &nbsp;Place this where most of the enemies you will be fighting are, or where a boss is. &nbsp;Keep in mind that Hawk Eye will also boost this even after swapping, so always weave before and after applying it!</li>
                            <li>Razor Caltrops (morph of Caltrops | Alliance War Assault skill line) – Updated in Morrowind to be a universally accessible skill (there is no cap on how many players can use this), Razor Caltrops adds immense AoE damage potential to every Stamina build around. &nbsp; The duration allows it to line up perfectly with our other back barred DoTs. &nbsp;The cost can be excessive though, so make sure you have a robust enough Stamina pool before going to your back bar.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Flex option; If you’re not comfortable with Caltrop’s insanely high cost, or having the trudge through Cyrodiil to get it; treat this slot as a flex spot.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Resolving Vigor (morph of Vigor | Alliance War Assault skill line) – A massive AoE heal over time accessible to anyone who’s ventured into Cyrodiil for a while. &nbsp;The healing potential this skill enables is massive, as well as giving some added group utility.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Flex option; If there’s a lot of negative effects in a fight, you can take Extended Ritual to remove them from yourself.&nbsp; You can also opt to take Restoring Focus for some extra mitigation, helping shrug off damage in some of the harder fights in the game.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ultimate Option 1 (Classic) Ballista (morph of Rapid Fire | Bow skill line) – One of the best single target ultimates in the game, this skill has a lot of potential. &nbsp;The ultimate itself does great damage, and can be empowered by the Hawk Eye passive, meaning you should always try to cast it after reaching 3 or more stacks. &nbsp;It will continue to fire even if you swap off your Bow bar, so try and make use of Dual Wield’s bonus damage by immediately swapping bars after casting.</li>
                            <li>Ultimate Option 2 (War Machine route) Crescent Sweep (morph of Radial Sweep | Aedric Spear skill line) – A super cheap ultimate that feels fantastic to use.&nbsp; Dealing a big burst of AoE damage upon activate, it will also passively radiate damage in an area around us for a bit after using.&nbsp; Target in front of you take 66% bonus damage, making it hit EXTREMELY hard, especially for how cheap it is.&nbsp; If you’re using the War Machine set, this will be the ultimate to activate.&nbsp; Using this will also ensure our Piercing Spear passive is active on our back bar as well!</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In this section you will find a multitude of options, trying to give every player an idea of what gear to go after.  Always try to experiment and find what works best for you, as there is no real universal “best”.  Keep in mind that most DPS builds will run very similar gear sets, but there are always deviations depending on the class and play style</p>

                            <li style="text-align: left;">Infector (found in Morrowind Overland events) – A new 5 piece set that dropped with Morrowind, it’s BoE and comes from many overland activities. &nbsp;Sharpened weapons will always be a pain to find, so if you can’t nab them go for the Shoulder and Helmet paired with jewelry instead.
                                <ul>
                                    <li style="text-align: left;">If you don’t have access to Infector, there are a multitude of powerful BoE Stamina sets in the base game. Spriggan’s (Bangkorai) offers immense penetration but may become redundant in group play, Witchman (The Rift) offers healing and resource management, as well as many other sets.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Hunding’s Rage (6 trait craftable) – A solid staple in Stamina DPS, helping your healing and damage dealing capabilities tremendously. &nbsp;While other sets like Nightmother’s and Spriggan’s might boast more raw damage to some players, Hunding’s flat amps helps the newer player who isn’t pushing out insane base DPS.</li>
                            <li>You’ll have some free slots available to you with this setup. &nbsp;I highly suggest getting some Health bonuses from either Monster sets or a crafted set like Ashen Grip (2 trait craftable) to help survive.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li style="text-align: left;">Nightmother’s (6 trait craftable)&nbsp;<strong>OR</strong>&nbsp;Spriggan’s (obtainable from Bangkorai overland events) – Both of these sets offer a great amount of damage to players who are comfortable with the game’s combat mechanics. &nbsp;They both offer a large % damage boost, meaning if you’re pulling lower numbers you’ll want a set like Hundings to replace them.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Agility (Imperial City or LFG rewards) – A powerful 3 piece set that has a 50% bonus to all of the set bonuses, helping it give a massive boost to Stamina and Weapon Damage.
                                <ul>
                                    <li style="text-align: left;">If you don’t mind grinding dungeons, Leviathan (Crypt of Hearts I &amp; II) offers an insane amount of Weapon Critical. &nbsp;Paired with the Major Savagery buff from potions you’ll be near 100% easily.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Any Monster set (Undaunted chests &amp; any dungeon) helps fill in each slot, whether it be two 1 pieces, or one 2 piece set. &nbsp;If you need Health, try mixing two 1 pieces such as Valkyn Skoria and Mephala’s, or if you want more damage go for Kra’gh’s, Velidreth, or Selene’s.</li>

                            <li>Kra’ghs (Fungal Grotto I) or Velidreth (Cradle of Shadows) both offer great damage to the end game player. &nbsp;Velidreth offers more burst damage and cleave potential, while Kra’gh’s offers more single target and passive damage.</li>
                            <li>Two Fanged Snake (Sanctum Ophidia Normal or Veteran) – The best Stamina set in the game in terms of raw damage, enabling a disgusting&nbsp;4300 Physical Penetration, giving us almost 10% flat damage increase. &nbsp;While not the easiest set to get, it will help tremendously.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&nbsp;In a group with a lot of Stamina DPS though, try using sets like Nightmother’s or Sunderflame to help everyone instead of just yourself.&nbsp; Always coordinate with your group to find out who is running what!&nbsp; If you use NMG or Sunder, use 2 Weapons (dual wield) and 3 armor pieces to ensure it reaches gold quality for maximum group utility.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Vicious Ophidian (Any Craglorn Trial Normal or Veteran) – Unparalleled resource management and set bonus efficiency nets this set on any good guide. &nbsp;Again, it’ll be harder to get than other sets, but the power it enables is immense.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If you’re in a group or you’re confident in your abilities, War Machine (Halls of Fabrication drop) is phenomenal in terms self AND group DPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you’re using Crescent Sweep to proc this if you take this route!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Maelstrom Bow (Veteran Maelstrom Arena) – Hands down the strongest weapon in the game for Stamina builds, enabling an absurd amount of damage. &nbsp;The grind is long, but it’s totally worth it.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div id="hidden3" style="display: none;">




                        <p><strong>Food:&nbsp;<em><span style="color: #339966;">Bi Health &amp; Stamina</span></em></strong>&nbsp;food offers the most damage by far, as well as helping our Health pool be sturdy enough. &nbsp;If you prefer more sustain however, try&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Dubious Cameron Throne</span></em></strong>&nbsp;(a holiday event recipe). &nbsp;You’ll need to spend some Attribute points in Health to make sure you’re healthy enough though!</p>
                        <p><strong>Potions:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Weapon Power potions</em></span></strong>&nbsp;(Blessed Thistle + Dragonthorn + Wormwood) to ensure your Savagery and Brutality are up indefinitely. &nbsp;This can get pricey, but try to always use them when fighting tougher content or bosses. &nbsp;You can use junk Stamina potions you find for non serious content.</p>
                        <p><strong>Race:&nbsp;Redguard</strong>&nbsp;remains the best overall choice for both sustain and damage, no doubts about it. &nbsp;<strong>Khajiit</strong>&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a solid raw damage producing race, but is slightly weaker for the Templar since PotL cannot crit on the explosion. &nbsp;<strong>Orcs and Imperials</strong>&nbsp;mix a good bit of damage and defensive stats for the solo player or PvPer, while&nbsp;<strong>Woodelf</strong>&nbsp;remains rather low on the totem pole for PvE. &nbsp;<strong>Any race</strong>&nbsp;can be done with this build, but if you’re looking to maximize your effectiveness then you’ll want to pick out of the listed races.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mundus:</strong>&nbsp;The best Mundus for PvE damage is by far the&nbsp;<strong>Warrior</strong>&nbsp;Stone for most Stamina builds. &nbsp;However&nbsp;if you find yourself solo a lot or not with top notch groups, the&nbsp;<strong>Lover</strong>&nbsp;is a great option as well.</p>
                        <p><strong>Traits on your Weapons:&nbsp;</strong>Traits are highly contextual in terms of what is best.&nbsp; A lot of values change based on group composition, buffs, debuffs, and what kind of player you are.&nbsp; Below is a breakdown of what traits I suggest depending on some of these variables;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>If using&nbsp;</em>Dual Wield;&nbsp;<strong>Nirnhoned&nbsp;</strong>on your main hand and&nbsp;<strong>Sharpened&nbsp;</strong>on your off hand is ideal in most situations.&nbsp; If you add up all sources of Physical Resistance Reduction and Penetration, and that number is above 15000, then do not use Sharpened.&nbsp; Instead use&nbsp;<strong>Precise</strong>.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>If using&nbsp;</em>Two Handed;&nbsp;<strong>Nirnhoned</strong>&nbsp;on your main hand is ideal.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bow Bar;&nbsp;<strong>Nirnhoned</strong>&nbsp;again is ideal.&nbsp; This&nbsp;simply helps all of our damage over time effects get a bit stronger while on this bar.&nbsp; The only skill that will retain this trait after swapping off, is Rearming Trap Beast.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Enchants/Poisons on your Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Enchants again are contextual.&nbsp; Below will explain the most powerful choices.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>If using</em>&nbsp;Dual Wield;&nbsp;<strong>Poison Damage&nbsp;</strong>on your main hand and&nbsp;<strong>Berserker</strong>&nbsp;(Increase Weapon + Spell Damage) on your off hand are ideal for enchants.&nbsp; Your Poison enchant will proc every 4 seconds, and your Berserker will be a buff that lasts 5 seconds on a 10 second ICD (internal cooldown).
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>If using&nbsp;</em>Two Handed;&nbsp;<strong>Poison Damage or Berserker</strong>&nbsp;is ideal.&nbsp; Poison damage helps your single target burst, while Berserker will be better for AoE damage and self healing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bow Bar;&nbsp;<strong>Damage Health Poison IX&nbsp;</strong>is ideal.&nbsp; These are a crafted poison that require&nbsp;<span style="color: #808000;"><em>Fleshfly Larva,&nbsp;<span style="color: #993366;">Nightshade,&nbsp;<span style="color: #00ccff;">and Violet&nbsp;Coprinus.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span style="color: #993366;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span style="color: #000000;">These should have two components, “Deals X Poison Damage per second for 4.5 seconds.” as well as “Deals X Poison Damage per second for 6.4 seconds. (10s cooldown)”&nbsp; The 4.5s and 6.4s will only be that high if you have Rank III Medicinal Use passive.&nbsp; If you aren’t keen on constantly spending money to get these poisons you are free to use an&nbsp;<strong>Absorb Stamina</strong>&nbsp;enchant instead.&nbsp; You will&nbsp;deal MUCH less overall damage however.</span></span></span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Traits on your Armor:&nbsp;</strong>All&nbsp;<strong>Divines</strong>&nbsp;boasts the best DPS. &nbsp;You’re free to have&nbsp;<strong>Infused on large pieces</strong>&nbsp;if you want to enchant for Max Health to help survivability, or Stamina to help a tiiiiny bit with sustain.</p>

                        <p>This segment shows the optimal CP setup for a player who is well knowledged in animation canceling and their rotation.</p>
                        <p>If you’re still learning your rotation or don’t have access to groups, try taking a few points out of Thaumaturge and Precise Strikes, and bumping up Piercing and Physical Weapon Expert.</p>

                                    <li>If your group is applying a lot of Physical Resistance Reduction buffs or you’re running a lot of innate Penetration, you can lower Piercing.&nbsp; Remember that if you add up all sources of Pen+Reduction and it’s over 18200, you’re not gaining any benefit.&nbsp; If this is the case, start pumping up nodes like Master at Arms, Thaumaturge, and Physical Weapon expert.</li>

                        <p>The rotation of the Stamina&nbsp;Templar can be incredibly easy to begin with, but becomes rather difficult if you’re trying to maximize their damage and group utility.&nbsp; Below will give a rough guide line of how to approach playing the Stamina Templar in a single target encounter.&nbsp; There is also a simple video showing how our rotation might look in a single target fight.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>&nbsp;Apply Buffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly Cloak (15s), and potentially Restoring Focus* (19s)</li>
                            <li>Begin placing DoTs. &nbsp;Always start by placing&nbsp;Endless Hail (10s duration) on your enemy, as it has a 2s wait time before dealing damage. &nbsp;Immediately press Trap Beast (12s duration) as you place&nbsp;Endless Hail , and then Light Attack weave a&nbsp;Caltrops*&nbsp;(14s duration). &nbsp;Light Attack weave again with a&nbsp;Poison Injection (10s duration) and bar swap immediately. &nbsp;Light Attack weave a&nbsp;Power of the Light (6s) and then a Rending Slashes (9s).</li>
                            <li>Begin “spam” mode; repeatedly Light Attack or Heavy Attack weaving Biting Jabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be able to get off 3-4 Jabs in quick succession.</li>
                            <li>By now some of your DoTs and buffs are fading.&nbsp; Reapply Power of the Light and immediately barswap.&nbsp; Now Light Attack into an Endless Hail, Light Attack into a Trap Beast, Light Attack into a Caltrops, Light Attack into a Poison Injection, and bar swap.&nbsp; If you’re using War Machine, cast Radial Sweep after Poison Injectioning, and bar swap immediately.&nbsp; Retrace step 1-4 until target dies.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>* denotes an optional step that not every player will want to do. &nbsp;These can be considered extra steps until you are comfortable with the “base” rotation. &nbsp;</em></p>
